# Traffic Flow Prediction Models

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and evaluating three predictive models for traffic flow forecasting. The models range from a traditional time-series approach to advanced deep learning methods, incorporating external variables to enhance prediction accuracy.

## üöÄ Models Developed
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model A: **ARIMA Model**
- Uses historical traffic flow data for time-series forecasting.
- Baseline model to compare deep learning performance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model B: **LSTM Model**
- Utilizes historical traffic flow data.
- Implements a deep learning-based sequential model for improved long-term forecasting.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model C: **Enhanced LSTM Model**
- Incorporates additional variables such as:
  - **Weather conditions**
  - **Rainfall data**
  - **Temperature**
  - **Weekend patterns**
- Aim to enhance predictive accuracy beyond Model B.
